<p>This is the home of the Apple2 portable Apple //e emulator. It's based on GCC and SDL2, and runs on Linux, Windows, and MacOS X. It's powered by Virtual 65C02<sup>TM</sup>, and sports an easy to use yet powerful interface.</p>

<p>This emulator came about because of ApplePC. It was a DOS only application with a horrible interface, and you had to tune it to get it work at the correct speed for your machine, but it had absolutely to most accurate looking screen that I have even seen on an Apple emulator at that time and ever since. Current emulators <i>still</i> to this day can't match the fidelity of what that old DOS program could do. So, to make a long story even longer, ApplePC disappeared off the face of the earth and I thought it was a shame that the screen rendering of that emulator should disappear with it. Also, there are, for some reason, absolutely no Apple II emulators for Linux! A deplorable situation! And so I resolved to fix that situation by figuring out how ApplePC did its video tricks and by writing an emulator for Linux.</p>

<p>Currently, only a source code archive is available. More will be coming in the near future... You can get a copy of the source code like so:</p>

<p><tt>git clone http://shamusworld.gotdns.org/git/apple2</tt></p>
