KNOWN ISSUES WITH APPLE2 EMULATOR
---------------------------------

 - Some disk images don't properly boot when the apple is powered on and *then*
   a disk is inserted (Ape Escape, Apple Panic).  Could be related to the
   Infocom squeezed disk format problem (Border Zone, others).

 - Border Zone doesn't read side B properly; there is a synchronization issue
   where the disk read routines run at 27 cycles per byte while the LSS runs
   with an OBT (optimal bit timing) of 28.  Eventually, the LSS will run
   ahead(!) of the 65c02--even though the 65c02 is running a faster loop--
   resulting in bytes being missed by the 65c02 (sometimes 2 bytes in a row
   being missed).  Very strange!

 - Inserting a new blank disk in drive #2 doesn't work (the code hasn't been
   written yet)

 - A new blank disk is given a default name and saved in the same folder as the
   apple2 executable.  This should at a minimum save the image in the "disks"
   folder (however that is defined in apple2.cfg); it should also allow the
   user to set the name of the disk image as well.

 - Saving/loading save states through the GUI doesn't work yet

 - Some (most) config options don't work through the GUI yet

 - Attaching hard drive images can only be done by editing apple2.cfg

 - There is no emulation of 800K drives yet

 - 13 sector disks don't work yet

 - Scrolling though the list of disks to get to one near the end of the list
   takes a *lot* of clicks.  Should probably make some form of type-ahead
   filtering to narrow the list down.  Maybe should also sort the disks better
   as well by ignoring starting articles such as a, an, the, & etc.

 - The disk selector doesn't give you any useful information about the disk
   you're highlighting (other than the full name at the top of the window); it
   should probably at a minimum give memory/machine stats for the disk.

 - No support for joysticks of any kind (even emulated Atari sticks via
   keyboard)
